            <p>I am currently working as a production manager and quality control manager at Allied Painters Inc.
                We paint everything from old houses to new houses to industrial buildings and everything inbetween.
                A typical day for me would consist of driving anywhere from Logan, UT to Payson, UT.

                Long before I was born, my dad was getting tired of working temporary jobs and came up with a plan.
                He made a trip to the library and found a couple of books about computers. He dove right in and realized
                he had a knack for this kind of stuff. After reading all the books he started taking tests and getting
                certified in all different areas of the computing world. He eventually got a job as a programmer and has
                been happy in his career ever since.

                Growing up, my dad was able to build a lot of cool things using his extensive knowledge. It sparked
                something
                in me and coding is something that I have been wanting to learn since I was around the age of 14. I
                first tried learning java but that is a big mistake for a beginner. It kind of turned me off to the programming
                 world and I
                forgot about it. But when I learned about all the cool stuff you could do with just HTML and CSS, I was
                hooked.
